# My-independent-game---Space-Explorers
Its my own made game, named- Space Explorers.
Rule- i)Infinte version- Collect as much as fuel and douch obstacles, keep an eye on fuel left and damage level, land on green planet to refuel(floting fuel canisters can also increase fuel levels by 20%) and repair the SpaceCraft.
Rule- i)Infinite & levels version- Same rule as of "Infinte version" ,but there you have to collect space garbage accordingly to Different-level and score.
